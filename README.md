# Code-Refractor

CHANGES I MADE:
- Changed the content of the title to be more descriptive

- removed the closing /> from the meta tag

- Got rid of the header class and deleted the period for all the affected header on CSS.

- replaced the div tag for a nav tag for in the headers menu because this defines as a set of navigation links to the website.

- replaced the parent div tag to section tag and for the individual children div tags, I replaced it with a article tag because each of these articles are self-contained contents. 

- Put a alt and title attribute to all the images on the page. Which specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image cannot be displayed.

- In the image tag for online reputation management, the class was specified as float-right which I removed and removed in CSS as well and replaced it with float-left.

- replaced the parent div tag to aside tags which indirectly relates to the surrounding content. Also replaced the children div tags to article tags which are self-contained contents as well.

- replaced the heart symbol with a mark up code to be displayed on all web browser.

- Condensed the CSS tags that had the same properties into a group.
