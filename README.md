# Code-Refractor

CHANGES I MADE:

* I had an issue with my terminal where the the command "code ." would not open up VSCode after I made a new repository from github. So doing a bit of research, it gave me a solution to install the command code through VSCode so when I punch it in through the terminal, it would open up. Here is the solution that helped me solve this issue: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29955500/code-not-working-in-command-line-for-visual-studio-code-on-osx-mac

* Another issue I came across was my style.css file was not syncing with my html file. It was a simple fix of going back a folder with ../ and since its case sensitive, I capitalized the A for Assets then followed up with /style.css. Also I added the type="text/css". I changed it for all the sources the images were coming from as well. Credit: https://digicompdiy.wordpress.com/2013/09/26/how-do-i-link-a-css-file-in-a-different-folder/

- Changed the content of the title to be more descriptive

- removed the closing /> from the meta tag

- Got rid of the header class and deleted the period for all the affected header on CSS. Same thing applied for the footer class as well. 

- replaced the div tag for a nav tag for in the headers menu because this defines as a set of navigation links to the website.

- replaced the parent div tag to section tag and for the individual children div tags, I replaced it with a article tag because each of these articles are self-contained contents. 

- Put a alt and title attribute to all the images on the page. Which specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image cannot be displayed.

- In the image tag for online reputation management, the class was specified as float-right which I removed and removed in CSS as well and replaced it with float-left.

- replaced the parent div tag to aside tags which indirectly relates to the surrounding content. Also replaced the children div tags to article tags which are self-contained contents as well.

- replaced the heart symbol with a mark up code to be displayed on all web browser.

- Condensed the CSS tags that had the same properties into a group.
